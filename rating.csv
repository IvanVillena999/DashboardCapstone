"For the benefit of researchers, journalists, students, and other practitioners, the tables NEED to be downloadable. Visually, it does not make sense to restrict the tables to 10 rows-- how can users glance over 1,634 rows with just 10 rows per page?  The choice of statistics is quite odd. For instance, in the voter's turnout page, there was a disaggregation based on age, gender, and marital status but what was reported was the actual number of people who voted. If the users are interested in actual turnouts, there should also be the data on registrations by age, gender, and marital status so the percentage turnouts can be manually calculated. In addition, I'm not sure what the value is of presenting the number of candidates and number of elected seats when we know that the number of seats vary a lot from LGU to LGU. Other pieces of information, like vote shares per candidate or party, would be much more helpful to a wider set of audience.  In general, the dashboard is a good initiative that could be made very useful but I hope the dashboard should not just SHOW the data but also make it easy to download, use, and analyze.",2

"It would have been better if the data presented in the dashboard were accurate (not for illustration purpose), given some questions in the survey relate to accuracy of the information. Overall, the dashboard would be really useful for everyone’s use.",3
